Inside Out Community Arts,"Inside Out's mission is to transform the lives of youth from underserved communities through arts and media education. Our multidisciplinary after school arts programs promote healthy interaction among diverse at-risk and underserved Los Angeles middle school and high school youth. Led by specially trained teams of professional artists, Inside Out bridges cultural, geographic, socioeconomic and differently-abled boundaries to support youth in creating and presenting topical theater, art and media. Our programs empower youth with the tools, confidence and inspiration to make a positive difference in their communities and the world ... from the inside out.

Inside Out’s programs were developed in response to a need for violence-prevention after school programs for middle school youth following the Los Angeles civil unrest of 1992. The program’s dramatic success led to the founding of Inside Out Community Arts in 1996.  Since then, Inside Out has been providing multidisciplinary arts and media based programs to middle school and high school youth from disadvantaged communities throughout Los Angeles. Our programs, which are all free to youth and families, immerse at-risk youth in a spectrum of theatre, movement, arts and media curricula that adheres to the California Theatre Content and English-Language Arts Standards.

"The Children's Clinic, ""Serving Children and Their Families""","The Children’s Clinic, ""Serving Children and Their Families"" (TCC), was founded in 1939 by a group of physicians and community leaders who recognized the importance of access to healthcare for all children, particularly those who are from low income families and who are at risk for health problems. Since then, TCC has grown from offering weekly well-child care to daily, full service health care with primary care services for children, adolescents and adults. TCC is known as a unique leader in the greater Long Beach community, addressing disparities in health by providing quality care for the under-served of all ages, offering them a true “medical home”.

Drive Details:
This holiday season, The Children’s Clinic is holding its Holiday Toy and Book Drive. We are transforming 3 of our 8 clinic sites into a Toy Shop where the parents and caregivers of some of our most needy patients will be able to select toys for their children. We will also have Santa come around to each of our clinic locations, handing out toys and books to children in the waiting rooms. As part of our pediatric literacy program, Reach Out and Read, we are always in need of children's book donations to give to our patients after reading to them in the patient waiting rooms.","2790 Atlantic Avenue, Long Beach, CA 90806",1.562.264.4656,hpace@thechildrensclinic.org,"uninsured/underinsured families, homeless families, children",http://www.thechildrensclinic.org/,,"Financial donations, Toys (Gifts), youth and children's books"

Cause for Celebration,"Birthdays are a special time of year. Some might even say a birthday party is a fundamental annual rite of passage.

That is where we come in. Cause for Celebration provides birthday parties to low income children and families. We believe that children should be celebrated throughout the year, and not just during the holidays. (Although we celebrate them then too!)

The Eli Home,"The Eli Home, Inc., a non-profit child abuse prevention organization, has operated in Orange County for the past 29 years.  Its shelter in Anaheim Hills is in crisis.  Because of a tremendous drop in donations, the Eli Board of Directors has decided to close the shelter home on January 1st, 2013, unless enough money is raised to keep the doors open. The decrease in donations is attributed to the economic condition and also a funders' focus on permanent housing rather than emergency or transitional shelters.  The stark reality is that there is a lack of permanent housing for victims of child abuse and domestic violence, while emergency and transitional shelters often are the only options that remain available to them.        After a very high profile and contentious battle to open the home in 1993 and a long history of being a safe haven to abused children and their mothers, the shelter closure would leave a large gap in shelter availability for homeless abused children.  The shelter has 7 bedrooms and is in full operation.   No other shelter in Orange County offers the specific programs and services that Eli provides.  There are other shelters for battered women, however, the focus and criteria for entrance into The Eli Home is homeless abused children.  The Eli Home needs to raise $200,000 by December 31st, to ""Save The Eli Home.""  Donations can be made online at www.elihome.org/donate or checks can be sent to ""Save the Eli Home"", 1175 N.
