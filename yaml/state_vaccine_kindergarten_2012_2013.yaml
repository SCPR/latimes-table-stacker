    description: "A parent-led movement to stop vaccinations is showing up in schools. While public schools require children to have up-to-date vaccines before a child can enroll, parents have the option of waiving the shots if they conflict with their personal beliefs. Children with medical conditions sometimes get waivers as well. In some schools in Southern California, kids with Personal Belief Exemptions make up a majority of incoming kindergartners â€“ and that worries public health officials. This user-friendly database shows 2012-13 vaccination exemption rates for incoming kindergartners at schools in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, based on data from the California Department of Public Health."
