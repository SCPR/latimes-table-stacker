  description: '<p>In California, 62 out of 349 legally operating commercial bus companies have racked up enough safety violations to appear on a watch list kept by the Department of Transportations Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.</p><p>The list ostensibly allows for increased inspections -- although California Highway Patrol officers say they cant pull the buses over simply for being on the list.</p><p>Among the companies on the watch list is Scapadas Magicas, the National City company that owns the bus that crashed in Yucaipa on Feb. 3. Seven people died and another 20 were injured in the crash.</p><p>The federal records are hard to search, so as a service to our audience, KPCC has created this searchable database of safety records of commercial bus companies in California.</p><p><a class="btn btn-info" href="#">Read More</a></p>'
