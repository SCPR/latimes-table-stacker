The safety information is based on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Measurement System used to evaluate a company&#39;s safety performance, and seven Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (BASICSs).</p>'
  content_explainer: '<p class="small-writing"><strong>About this database: </strong>This tables shows three levels of designation beneath the Status heading. <strong>See BASIC Link</strong> refers to how a carrier has performed on the Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories system. <strong>Insufficient:</strong> means a given company may not have sufficient inspections or violations to generate an evaluation for a specific BASIC category, and thus does not indicate poor safety fitness. To see a further explanation of the BASIC ratings or a carrier&#39;s Safety and Fitness Electronic Records profile, click on the respective links. <strong>Further monitoring</strong> is commonly known as the watchlist, meaning the carrier is over the intervention threshold or based on the data may be prioritized for further monitoring. The table also displays the reason the carrier is in need of further monitoring, designated by "Violation", "Alert", or both. <strong>Violation</strong> denotes "a serious violation cited within last 12 months from an investigation." <strong>Alert</strong> denotes the carrier may be prioritized for an intervention action and roadside inspection.</p>'
