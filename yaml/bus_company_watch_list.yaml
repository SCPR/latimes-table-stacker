    description: '<p>When it comes to the agency responsible for regulating and inspecting bus lines, shuttles and motor coaches, a distinction is made between an intrastate carrier and an interstate carrier.</p><p>Those that never leave the state of California are known as intrastate carriers and are regulated by the <a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/puc/">California Public Utilities Commission</a> (PUC).</p><p>Those that transport passengers to and from destinations outside the state are known as interstate carriers and are regulated by the the Department of Transportation&#39;s <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/PCS/Consumers.aspx">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a>, which provides details for 370 of these companies.</p><p>According that data, <a href="http://ai.fmcsa.dot.gov/PassengerSearch/SearchResults.aspx?LocationCode=2&amp;amp;LocationValue=CA&amp;amp;VehicleType=Motorcoach&amp;amp;keyword=&amp;amp;Submit=Find+Carriers">54 of the 370</a> -- about 19 percent -- have racked up enough safety violations to appear on a "watchlist" kept by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.</p><p>An appearance on this watchlist means the carrier has been prioritized for further monitoring by regulators. This could mean increased inspections, and occurs when a carrier is over the intervention threshold based on inspection scores, or because a serious violation was found during an inspection or investigation.</p><p>The table below shows the 370 California interstate carriers broken down by three <strong>"Carrier Status"</strong> categories. Those prioritized for further monitoring carry the <strong>"Further Monitoring"</strong> designation in addition to the reason for the designation in the <strong>Watchlist Reason</strong> column.</p><p><strong>"Violation"</strong> denotes "a serious violation cited within last 12 months from an investigation." <strong>"Alert"</strong> denotes the carrier may be prioritized for an intervention action and roadside inspection.</p>'
