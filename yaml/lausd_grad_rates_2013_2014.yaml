    description: "<p>Last week the Los Angeles Unified released preliminary school-by-school graduation rates.</p><p>The database below shows the 2013-2014 and 2012-2013 graduation rate for LA Unified comprehensive high schools based on the that year's cohort &ndash; essentially a group of students tracked for four years beginning when they enter the ninth grade. Students are removed from the cohort if they transfer and re-enroll in other public schools. Students are added to the cohort if they enroll at a LA Unified school after the ninth grade.</p><p>Final numbers will be released in spring 2015 after summer graduations and other adjustments are included.</p><p>Overall, the <a href='http://home.lausd.net/apps/news/show_news.jsp?REC_ID=406124&id=0' target='blank'>district graduation rate rose to 77 percent</a>. The preliminary rate trails the latest statewide measure of around 80 percent, but increased by 12 percentage points from 65 percent.</p>"
