Publish CSV files as interactive tables using "TableFu":https://github.com/eyeseast/python-tablefu, "Django":http://www.djangoproject.com/, "jQuery":http://jquery.com/ and "Google App Engine":http://code.google.com/appengine/.

You can see an example table working "here":http://table-stacker.appspot.com/example_formatted/.

Beware. This software is in beta testing and hasn’t been used much. But don’t let that stop you! Please try it and tell me what sucks.

All of the good stuff in here was written by "ProPublica's News Application Desk":http://www.propublica.org/nerds or "Chris Amico":http://www.chrisamico.com/blog/. Blame me for whatever sucks.
