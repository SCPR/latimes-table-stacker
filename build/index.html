The warnings began with letters sent to 141 dispensaries on March 7 and another 60 on March 23. Dispensaries targeted include those that did not register to participate in a lottery &mdash; not yet scheduled &mdash; that will select 100 collectives to operate in the city. Operators of 231 dispensaries have applied to be included in the drawing.</p>

The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports the production of all mines that produce more than 4 million short tons. In 2009, 47 mines qualified by the list. All together, major mines produced more than 650 million short tons of coal, a majority of the roughly 1 billion total short tons unearthed across the nation. Wyoming mines dominate the list, filling out the first nine positions.</p>
